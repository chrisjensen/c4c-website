<h2>Why Switch Power?</h2>
<p>Some big corporations are working against renewable energy, spending big money lobbying our government against action on climate change to protect their profits. </p>
<p>These are the same companies that many of us buy our energy from, by telling them you won&rsquo;t stand for it and switching your power to a better company, you can support energy companies that are helping to make climate action possible and show the dirty energy companies that their actions don&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>In this action, we’ll help you to understand who&rsquo;s responsible, and what you can do about it.</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>For your action to have the most impact, your energy company needs to know why they&rsquo;ve lost your business so they know their actions on climate change are important to customers.</p>
<p>Send them a quick message to let them know why you've switched.</p>
<p>Tips for writing a message:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell them you know they lobbied against the RET</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include your customer reference number / account number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell them you&rsquo;ve taken your business elsewhere (they might not make the connection if you don&rsquo;t).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be polite. The person reading your message may not even be aware of their employer&rsquo;s actions.</p>
</li>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a former customer and I am writing to let you know that I have changed to another power company because of your actions on the RET.</p>
<p>I am concerned about Climate Change and I believe that having an ambitious Renewable Energy Target is important for a safe climate and the future of Australia. I was disappointed to learn that you have lobbied the Government to have the RET scrapped or reduced in 2015.</p>
<p>I hope in future you will chose more responsible climate action.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
