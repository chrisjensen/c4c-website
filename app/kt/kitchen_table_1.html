<h1 dir="ltr">Kitchen Table Conversation #1</h1>
<h4 dir="ltr">Making climate action a social affair</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Welcome to your first Kitchen Table Conversation - making climate change a social affair! We hope you&rsquo;re excited to get started - and it's okay if you're also a bit nervous</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Are you all comfortable? Do you have some nibbles and your beverage of choice in front of you? Yes? Then let&rsquo;s dive straight in&hellip;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">So...what are we doing again?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Throughout each of these Kitchen Table Conversations, you will:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Get Informed</strong> - Drill into what climate change means, the solutions and explore questions together</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reach Out</strong> - Learn and practice techniques for having effective climate conversations</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Stand Up</strong> - Take action to create the social Climate for Change</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Watch our <a href="http://www.climateforchange.org.au/kt_welcome_video">Welcome Video</a> to get you started.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">1) Get Informed: Getting your head around climate change</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you had a chance to do the getting ready the climate change story, great! If not, take a moment now to read it as a group (you may want to do this even if you have read it before so as to refresh your memory)</p>
<h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Reading Recap:</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Climate change is happening and it&rsquo;s happening now. We are already seeing more extreme heat days, bushfires, droughts, intense storms, sea level rise, and more.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">There are feedback loops in our weather system such as melting ice and permafrost that, once they reach a certain scale, a tipping point, will cause runaway climate change that will be beyond our power to stop.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">This is a global humanitarian problem, not just an &lsquo;environmental&rsquo; problem, and we are running out of time.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="ltr"><strong>Discuss:</strong></h4>
<p dir="ltr">Keeping what you&rsquo;ve just read in mind, take 15mins to discuss the following questions one-by-one:</p>
<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">How might global warming impact other big issues that we are facing like health, people seeking asylum, funding for roads, transport, education? (5 mins)</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">What would happen to those things and our society if extreme weather continues to increase? (5 mins)</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">How much of this do you think people (your friends, neighbours, colleagues) understand? (5 mins)</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">That last question brings us to this weeks topic for &lsquo;Reach Out&rsquo;...</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">2) Reach Out: Why talk about climate change?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">No seriously, why bother? In the next guide we&rsquo;ll take you through how to get the most out of your conversations (and how to enjoy them too). But before we do that, we should all be clear on why we&rsquo;re doing it&hellip; and why we&rsquo;re not already doing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why the silent treatment?</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before reflecting on the reading, let&rsquo;s just get a few things out in the open and think very briefly about why we don&rsquo;t talk about climate change. There are many reasons people avoid the subject &ndash; all of which are completely normal and understandable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most common reasons for staying silent that we&rsquo;ve come across (often in ourselves) are:</p>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t know enough and don&rsquo;t want to look stupid</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s too big, too scary, and there&rsquo;s nothing I can do about it anyway so talking about it is pointless</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t want to be a kill joy &ndash; nobody else cares anyway</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;m not a greenie or an activist &ndash; I don&rsquo;t want to be seen as a bleeding heart</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">I don&rsquo;t want to get into a difficult conversation that I can&rsquo;t handle</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Does this sound familiar? Take just 5 mins to talk about what you&rsquo;re most worried about when it comes to talking about climate change. (use a timer&hellip; we don&rsquo;t want to get stuck here when there&rsquo;s so much more interesting things to get stuck on!)</p>
<p dir="ltr">By understanding how important these conversations really are, we can perhaps acknowledge the above fears&hellip; and then do it anyway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reading Recap:</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you all had a chance to read just read through this recap together. If not run through the it together now:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.climateforchange.org.au/kt1_conversations">Climate Conversations Tutorial #1</a>
</p>
<p>The key reasons why it&rsquo;s so important to have conversations about climate change are:</p>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">That&rsquo;s how social change happens. When people hear early adopters like you talking about it and the actions you are doing as if it were as normal as talking about what you did on the weekend, then others get interested and involved and we move along the social diffusion curve towards a critical mass of active citizens that cannot be ignored.
			<br class="kix-line-break" />Here&rsquo;s a fun <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement?language=en">3 minute video</a> that shows that spread and critical mass in action.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Conversation done well and often and by many people combats misinformation and allows us to see that actually, most people really are concerned just like you are, and want to do something about it. This concern is then seen as normal rather than radical.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">We need the support of those around us. Climate change is hard, and often heart breaking. Grief and despair are normal but we can&rsquo;t let that paralyse us. Our friends can help us.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Discuss:</strong> 10 mins</p>
<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">How change happens: How do you feel about the idea that conversations can change the world?<em> (If this idea bewilders you, never fear, you&rsquo;ll dig deeper into it in later sessions)</em>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>Conversational norms: In the getting ready reading we asked you to think about whether blanket statements about our humanity applied to you:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
	<p dir="ltr"><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal to talk about how people are selfish, inconsiderate and how we can&rsquo;t act on climate change unless it is cost effective. In our gatherings we hear this all the time&hellip; &ldquo;people just don&rsquo;t care&rdquo;, &ldquo;people will only care when it affects them directly&rdquo;, &ldquo;it all comes down to money&rdquo;, and so on and so forth.&rdquo;</em>
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Now, ask each other whether or not these statements apply to those of you in the room? What about your friends, family, acquaintances?</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, at the end of all of that&hellip; who do you want to invite into the conversation? (follow the activity to think about this)</p>

					<h2 dir="ltr">ACTIVITY: Circle of influence (aka people you know and like)</h2>
					<p dir="ltr">(15 minutes)</p>
					<p dir="ltr">The world is big, climate change is big, and it can be easy to feel very small. But focusing on your own circle of influence can help each of us to get past this feeling and to find others to work with, collaborate with and share the burden.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">As you start out on this odyssey of conversation, the first step is to talk to people you already know, your social circles, your workplaces, your neighbours etc.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">You may have someone in mind who you would like to invite into the conversation&hellip; but have you considered everyone? This simple exercise will help you to visualise your social circles and think about the best places to start.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
					<ol>
						<li dir="ltr">
							<p dir="ltr">Grab a piece of scrap paper (A4 or larger)</p>
						</li>
						<li dir="ltr">
							<p dir="ltr">Write your name or simply &ldquo;me&rdquo; at the centre of the paper</p>
						</li>
						<li dir="ltr">
							<p dir="ltr">Start to think about your different social circles &ndash; most of us have a few e.g. work, old school friends, friends you&rsquo;ve met through a hobby, friends of friends, neighbours.</p>
						</li>
						<li dir="ltr">
							<p dir="ltr">For now simply write down what the different groups are, scattering them around the page.
								<br class="kix-line-break" />(see rough example below of what your map might look like)</p>
						</li>
						<li dir="ltr">
							<p dir="ltr">Then, start to add names linked to those groups. Feel free to work together on parts of this map if you have similar or overlapping groups of friends&hellip; but everyone should have their own map</p>
						</li>
						<li dir="ltr">
							<p dir="ltr">Looking at your map, ask yourself: Who do I want to talk to most about this? Where would conversations be most effective and build a life of their own? Where might conversations be too difficult for now? These may be specific people, or they may be groups.</p>
						</li>
						<li dir="ltr">
							<p dir="ltr">We will revisit this map in later sessions (including in your first Challenges below), so hold on to it!</p>
						</li>

<h2 dir="ltr">3) Stand Up: By reaching out</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Welcome to your first set of Challenges. As you may have already experienced, one of the hardest things to do about climate change is to shift the conversation. Yet this is how we change social norms and reach a critical mass of people pushing for action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So this first round of Challenges is all about reaching out and noticing how we might shift the conversation around climate change.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Challenges (Round 1):</h4>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1) &nbsp;Draft a letter/email to friends:</strong> As you&rsquo;ve by now read and discussed, we all need support from our friends and family and we need to get the word out. Your first challenge this week is to draft a letter to friends telling them about why you&rsquo;re concerned about climate change, the actions you are taking and those you plan to take. This letter will be for friends that you haven&rsquo;t yet connected with on this topic.</p>
<p>At this stage, we&rsquo;re just asking you to draft the letter, you don&rsquo;t need to send it (yet)&hellip; you&rsquo;ll revisit the letter in the final weeks of this course to see if you&rsquo;re thinking differently about your approach given what you will have learnt about climate change and communicating climate change over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Get started on your letter by following <a href="http://www.climateforchange.org.au/act_letter_friends">these steps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2) &nbsp;Notice conversational norms:</strong> Conversational norms like the ones mentioned during getting ready can be so normal they&rsquo;re almost invisible. So this week, become a bit of a social norms detective - have a go at noticing when people are saying things in a conversation simply because it is the normal thing to say. Like&hellip;</p>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">What do people say over and over about things like work, parents &hellip;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">about traffic and commuting &hellip;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">about the government &hellip;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">about going to the gym &hellip;</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">about how busy they are ...</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3) Reach out via social media:&nbsp;</strong>You can spread the social norm online too: Like our facebook page to receive more materials that you can share with your social networks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking for something more you can do? As we continue, we&rsquo;ll be giving you bigger actions to take, but if you really can&rsquo;t wait, you can go to our actions page to find some more things you can do. (<a href="http://www.climateforchange.org.au/actions">http://www.climateforchange.org.au/actions</a>)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Getting Ready for next time:</h2>
<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Psychology for a Safe Climate booklet: <a href="http://www.psychologyforasafeclimate.org/#!publications/c1erc">Facing the Heat</a>
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">A collection of stories about different climate conversations that people have had, to start thinking about the many shapes these conversations could take.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Final (very important) Tasks!</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Have you got a day, time and location for your next get together? If not, or if something has changed, organise the details now before you wrap up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remember, make sure it&rsquo;s in everyone&rsquo;s diary - create a social norm of committing time to Climate Change 😊</p>
