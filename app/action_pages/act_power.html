<h2>Why Switch Power?</h2>
<p>Some big corporations are spending big money lobbying our government against action on climate change to protect their profits. </p>
<p>These are the same companies that many of us buy our energy from. By telling them you won&rsquo;t stand for it and switching your power to a better company, you can support energy companies that are helping to minimise the impacts of climate change and show the dirty energy companies that their actions are not sustainable in the long-term.</p>
<p>In this action, we’ll help you to understand who&rsquo;s responsible for preventing Australia from taking a stronger stance on climate change, and what you can do about it.</p>

<div class="panel-heading">By switching to a cleaner power company you can also support Climate for Change.</div>

<p>Powershop will make a contribution to Climate for Change for everyone who switches to them through the Powershop link on our website or emails. So if you switch to Powershop, you&rsquo;ll be helping to support the work of Climate for Change.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to choose Powershop. By choosing any of the top three greenest electricity retailers, you&rsquo;ll be helping to support renewable energy and the Renewable Energy Target.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning to switch to Powershop, please use the link below as it will help us and Powershop to know that you switched through us.</p>

<h2>Before you Start</h2>
<p>You should get:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A copy of a recent electricity bill (less than 6 months old)<br class="kix-line-break" />(you can do this process without it, but it&rsquo;ll be easier with a bill in front of you)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>For your action to have the most impact, your energy company needs to know that they’ve lost you because of their actions on climate change and that these are important to customers.</p>
<p>Send them a quick message to let them know why you've switched.</p>
<p>Tips for writing a message:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tell them you know they lobbied against the Renewable Energy Target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include your customer reference number / account number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell them you&rsquo;ve taken your business elsewhere (they might not make the connection if you don&rsquo;t).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be polite. The person reading your message may not even be aware of their employer&rsquo;s actions.</p>

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a former customer and I am writing to let you know that I have changed to another power company because of your actions in relation to the Renewable Energy Target.</p>
<p>I am concerned about Climate Change and I believe that having an ambitious RETr is important for a safe climate and the future of Australia. I was disappointed to learn that your company lobbied the Government to have the RET scrapped or reduced in 2015.</p>
<p>I hope in future you will chose more responsible climate action.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>You can further support the Renewable Energy Target by choosing the GreenPower option with your energy provider.</p>
<p>By choosing one of the top energy retailers as ranked by Greenpeace, you are supporting a company that has supported the Renewable Energy Target. If you choose GreenPower, then your money will contribute to supporting the growth of renewable energy in Australia.</p>
<p>That means your GreenPower will help us to <em>exceed</em> the Renewable Energy Target, which is the kind of action we need right now.</p>
<h4 class="margintopmore">Buying GreenPower</h4>
<h5>Powershop</h5>
<p>Choose the Green Energy powerpacks in the online shop (you can set these as your default powerpack in your settings). By choosing these powerpacks, you will be purchasing power generated by Powershop’s own wind farms at Mt Mercer in Victoria and Mt Millar in South Australia.</p>
<h5>Diamond Energy</h5>
<p>Choose <a href="https://diamondenergy.com.au/diamond-pure-plus/" target="_blank">Diamond Pure Plus</a></p>
<h5>Momentum Energy</h5>
